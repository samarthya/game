## Application Tic Tac Toe

It is a simple game application of two users sticking to either `x` and `0` as a choice while trying to fill in a grid of 9 (3x3), alternatingly. A specific combination of 3 in a straight line or diagonal line will determine the winner. If no-one can complete the combination before exhausting their trials, it will result in a DRAW.
